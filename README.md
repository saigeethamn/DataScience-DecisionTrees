# DataScience-DecisionTrees

This repository contains a very basic demostration of the decision trees model using scikit learn


# Problem Statement
Given 6 parameter about a car, can we categorise the car as unacceptable, acceptable, good or very good.
The 6 parameters are 
- buying cost
- maintenance cost
- Number of doors
- Number of persons
- Luggage boot capacity
- Safety

# Modeling
The data is in a very clean state with no missine values.
So, just before modelling the categorical variables are encoded as part of feature engineering and then the model created

# Validation
The efficacy of the validation is checked through an accuracy score and confusion matrix after the model is applied on to a test dataset
